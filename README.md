Certainly! Precision and recall are key metrics used in evaluating the performance of a classification model, particularly in the context of binary classification. They provide insights into the classifier’s ability to identify relevant instances and handle false positives and false negatives.

Precision

Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It answers the question: “Of all instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?”

 \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}} 

	•	True Positives (TP): The number of instances correctly predicted as positive.
	•	False Positives (FP): The number of instances incorrectly predicted as positive (predicted as positive but actually negative).

A high precision indicates that the classifier has a low false positive rate.

Recall

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. It answers the question: “Of all the instances that were actually positive, how many did we correctly predict as positive?”

 \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}} 

	•	True Positives (TP): The number of instances correctly predicted as positive.
	•	False Negatives (FN): The number of instances incorrectly predicted as negative (predicted as negative but actually positive).

A high recall indicates that the classifier has a low false negative rate.

Example

Consider a scenario where we have a binary classification problem, such as detecting spam emails. Here’s a confusion matrix for a classifier:

	•	True Positives (TP): 50 (correctly identified spam emails)
	•	False Positives (FP): 10 (non-spam emails incorrectly identified as spam)
	•	True Negatives (TN): 90 (correctly identified non-spam emails)
	•	False Negatives (FN): 5 (spam emails incorrectly identified as non-spam)

Using this data, we can calculate precision and recall:

Precision

 \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{50}{50 + 10} = \frac{50}{60} \approx 0.83 

This means that out of all the emails the classifier predicted as spam, 83% were actually spam.

Recall

 \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{50}{50 + 5} = \frac{50}{55} \approx 0.91 

This means that out of all the actual spam emails, 91% were correctly identified by the classifier.

Trade-off

There is often a trade-off between precision and recall. Increasing precision can sometimes lower recall and vice versa. The balance between these two metrics depends on the specific application and the cost of false positives versus false negatives.

	•	High Precision, Low Recall: The classifier is conservative in its positive predictions, meaning it misses some actual positives but has fewer false positives.
	•	High Recall, Low Precision: The classifier captures most of the positive instances but also includes more false positives.

In summary, precision and recall are crucial for understanding the performance of a classifier, especially in scenarios where the costs of false positives and false negatives are significant.

There are features and a target in ML and the first are used to predict the second one

### The steps to building and using a model are:

- Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
- Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
- Predict: Just what it sounds like
- Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
